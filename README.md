By Roshan Kumar Jha

Project Description: This game has a board and a snake. There are food items on the board for the snake to consume. The snake moves around on the board and eats the food piece. As it consumes the food piece a new piece is created on the board and the snake length increases by 1. The user can control the direction of the snake with arrow keys. The player cannot stop the snake from moving while the game is in progress, and cannot make the snake go in reverse. If the snake head touches itself or the walls it dies. The game  has a high score option which updates as soon as the current score is surpassed and hence people can compete with each other for the high score.
